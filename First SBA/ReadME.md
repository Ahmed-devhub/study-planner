# Student Study Planner (NYC Edition)

This project was built as my submission for **SBA 307 – HTML & CSS**.  
It is a simple 3-page student study planner website that demonstrates the use of inline, internal, and external CSS styles as required.

## Pages I Created

- **Home (index.html)**  
  - Used **inline CSS** for all styling.  
  - Contains:
    - A **Weekly Study Plan table** with caption, thead, tbody, and rows for each day.  
    - A **Study Gallery** section with two images and one animated GIF.  
    - Header, navigation bar, footer.  
    - Semantic HTML5 structure (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).  

- **Explore (explore.html)**  
  - Used **internal CSS** inside a `<style>` tag.  
  - Contains:
    - A **form** with email input, dropdown menu to select a track, checkbox for tips, and submit button.  
    - A **list** (`ul`) that explains how the tracks work.  
    - Navigation bar styled with Flexbox.  
    - CSS animation (`gentleShake`) on the page heading.  
    - Added a **Submit button pulse animation** to help meet the 2-animations requirement.

- **Contact (contact.html)**  
  - Used **external CSS** linked through `style.css`.  
  - Contains:
    - A **form** with name input, dropdown menu for reason, and a large message textarea.  
    - Contact information section with email + typical reply time.  
    - Navigation bar styled with Flexbox.  
    - CSS animation (`gentleShake`) applied to the heading.  
    - Added a **Submit button pulse animation** here as well (second distinct animation).

## CSS Features I Used

- **Inline CSS** → `index.html`  
- **Internal CSS** → `explore.html`  
- **External CSS** → `contact.html` with `style.css`  
- **Flexbox** → Used for navigation menus and layout alignment.  
- **Animations** →  
  1. `gentleShake` (headings).  
  2. `subtlePulse` (Submit buttons).  
- **Selectors** → type, class, id, grouped selectors, child combinator, and pseudo-class `:hover`.
